This samples directory contains:

.rh.sh
------
Copy this to ~ and source it from your shell config (e.g., sh, ksh, zsh, bash)
to define the functions rq rql rqv ri ril riv re rel rev rei reil reiv
and the aliases rl rlr rv rvr rj r0 r1 r1l r1v ry ryl ryv rY rYl rYv.
It also contains commented-out environment variables that affect rh.
See rh(1) for details.

    cp samples/.rh.sh ~
    echo '. ~/.rh.sh' >> ~/.profile

brevity.rh
----------
Copy this to ~/.rhrc.d to define the functions i n u g a m su sg nu ng
r w x q sec mn hr dy wk mth yr. See rawhide.conf(5) for details.

    cp samples/brevity.sh ~/.rhrc.d

rawhide.conf-tiny
-----------------
This is a smaller version of /etc/rawhide.conf that excludes most of the
longer alternative names for things. Longer alternative names for some
built-ins remain. This might be preferable for resource-constrained systems.
Consider replacing rawhide.conf with this, if you configure --static=tiny.
You don't have to, but with --static=tiny, the default /etc/rawhide.conf
will consume half of the data space, but that's probably fine.

    cp -p samples/rawhide.conf-tiny ./rawhide.conf
    ./configure --static=tiny
    make
    sudo make install

perlsh
------
This is the wrapper script mentioned in rawhide.conf(5) that adapts perl for
use with "cmd".ush. Perl doesn't match the standard login shell invocation
convention, but this script does, so it can be used by rawhide as a user
shell.

    sudo cp -p samples/perlsh /usr/local/bin
    RAWHIDE_USER_SHELL=/usr/local/bin/perlsh
    export RAWHIDE_USER_SHELL

rhea-decode
-----------
This is the standalone script mentioned in rh(1) that decodes extended
attribute values in rh -j output as extracted by jq -r, e.g.:

    rh -j | jq -r '.extended_attributes["name"]' | rhea-decode
