# Extra tricky

# These tests (by St√©phane Chazelas) show how `` is more dangerous
# than $() when interpolation of %s/%S is done by quoting with
# backslashes (which is the method that used to be used by rh).
# When a pathname contains backticks, those backticks were backslashed
# by rh, but those backslashes would be processed within any backticks
# in the shell command, and so the contents of the internal backticks
# would be executed by the shell when parsing the final resulting command.
#
# The first two (commented out) tests show the original behaviour with
# `` when interpolation was done by quoting. The next two show the new
# fixed behaviour where %s/%S are passed as positional arguments to sh -c
# as "$1"/"$2" thus eliminating the problem that it isn't actually possible
# to interpolate by quoting because the context in which the interpolation
# happens affects which method of quoting is needed, and it's impossible to
# know what context(s) will be used without actually parsing the shell
# command (which is not an option). The last two tests show the equivalent
# shell command using $() rather than `` which worked safely with both
# methods of interpolation.
